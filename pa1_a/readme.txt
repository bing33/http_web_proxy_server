# A web proxy that is capable of accepting HTTP GET requests, forwarding the 	 #
# requests to remote (origin) servers, and returning response data to a client.  #
# ############################################################################## #

This is the first stage of the program, which supports only one client to be connected to the proxy server.

* To run the proxy server in command line, you can do the following: 

1. python pa1_a.py
	
   Note: this option will use the default port 8000

2. python pa1_a.py port#

   Note: this option will use the port number that you specify, eg: python pa1_a.py 6789

* To test the connection to the proxy server from firefox, please set the port number to 8000


* In firefox, it works for both: 

1. http://www.cs.utah.edu:80/~kobus/simple.html 
2. http://www.cs.utah.edu/~kobus/simple.html 

* With telnet, it works for both: 

1. GET http://www.cs.utah.edu/~kobus/simple.html HTTP/1.0
2. GET http://www.cs.utah.edu:80/~kobus/simple.html HTTP/1.0

* Also, with telnet, the following return 501 Not Implemented error: 

1. POST http://www.cs.utah.edu/~kobus/simple.html HTTP/1.0
2. HEAD http://www.cs.utah.edu/~kobus/simple.html HTTP/1.0
3. DELETE http://www.cs.utah.edu/~kobus/simple.html HTTP/1.0

* Note: with telnet, it only takes absolute URL, I tried for hours but couldnâ€™t get the relative url from telnet to work.
